# News Site

The assignment was to create a news site with different media queries. 
I created a news site about the economy of europe.

## The problem

This is my first project and I really struggle to make the content to be where I wanted it to be. I tried out different functions like grid, flexbox, I used unorder list and order list and created a navbar, though without working links but just to make it look good for the eye. To approach the problem with content that wasn't on the right page, I made colored borders around every content so I more easily could understand where the different boxes were and also the live server tool helped me a lot.
